    "## Introduction\n",
    "London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. It is one of the world's most important financial, commerce and educational centers. London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. Its estimated population is roughly 9 million, which made it the third-most populous city in Europe. If we are looking to open a new restaurant, this is one of the best cities to consider possible locations. This project can be useful for business owners and entrepreneurs who are looking to invest in a restaurant. The main objective of this project is to carefully analyze appropriate data and find recommendations for the stakeholders."
